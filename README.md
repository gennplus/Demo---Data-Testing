# Demo---Data-Testing
Some data testing practices using Python and libraries.


**The aim of this repo is to host MVP project for testing data quality following IBM terminology.**
1. Accuracy - Data should fit real life constraint such as scale, real values for category data, correlation, be relevant to time and region.
2. Completeness - Data should be cleared from empty values, empty columns or empty records. Number of records should be enough for meaningful prediction.
3. Consistency - Data should be represented in same format at same scale in the same column after collecting and preprocessing from every data source.
4. Uniqueness - Data should have no duplicated columns, no duplicated records and no 100% correlated columns such as length in meters and millimeters at same time.
